MaterialEditText
====================
This is an EditText that implements floating hints and inline errors, to match the material design guidelines.

[Example guideline image][example]

This implementation extends EditText directly, so you can substitute FloatingHintEditText for your existing EditTexts and things should Just Work (TM). No container layouts required.
